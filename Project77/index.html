        The console screen is the like the inside of a web app, we can see calculations and hidden messages. When we do a math problem such as 3*5+3 we can see the answer and the problem in the console screen.We can access it by right- clicking the page and hitting "Inspect" there, on the panel on the top we can see "console", we then click on it and then you have succesfully gotten into the console screen.
